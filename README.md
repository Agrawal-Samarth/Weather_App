# Simple Weather App üå§Ô∏è

A weather application that shows weather information for yesterday, today, and tomorrow for any city. Built as part of my ICT curriculum in class 8.

## About This Project

This project was built in class 8 as part of my ICT curriculum in school. It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional web application that connects to real-world APIs.

## What it does

- Enter a city name
- Get weather information for yesterday, today, and tomorrow
- Shows temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Type a city name in the search box
3. Click "Search" or press Enter
4. See the weather for yesterday, today, and tomorrow!

## Files in this project

- `index.html` - The main webpage
- `style.css` - Makes the app look pretty
- `script.js` - Makes the app work (gets weather data)

## Setup

### For Local Use:
1. Get a free API key from [WeatherAPI.com](https://weatherapi.com/)
2. Open `script.js` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

### For GitHub:
The API key is set to `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder for security. When you want to use the app:
1. Clone the repository
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `script.js` with your actual API key
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

## How it works

1. When you enter a city, the app first finds the city's coordinates
2. Then it gets the current weather for that location
3. It displays the weather in three cards: yesterday, today, and tomorrow

## Made with

- HTML (for structure)
- CSS (for styling)
- JavaScript (for functionality)
- Weather API (for weather data)
